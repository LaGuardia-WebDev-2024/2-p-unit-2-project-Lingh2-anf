<h1>Swiss Alps</h1>
      <h1 id="A1">Intro</h1>
  
        <p>
        To escape the pressures of my situation and to rehearse, I finds some peace and calm in the mountains of the 
        Engadine region in the <strong class="Swiss-Alps">Swiss Alps.</strong> In a defining moment of the film, I stands on a mountaintop and intensely 
        searches for a line of clouds that move like a snake and dramatically envelope the mountains with magical effect.

      <p>A stylish home from home in the heart of the Swiss Alps<br>
Pinewood from local forests, solid oak and slate. These materials generate a <em>warm atmosphere</em> and form the basis for the 
        stylish and elegant d√©cor which can be found in the 120 rooms and suites here at the Waldhotel Arosa. Decorated 
        with great attention to detail using materials of the finest quality, they offer guests a friendly and light ambience 
        with alpine charm and fabulous views of the <strong class="Swiss-Alps2">Swiss Apls.</strong> The long history of the hotel building means that 
        many of the rooms and suites are exceptionally large.</p>
