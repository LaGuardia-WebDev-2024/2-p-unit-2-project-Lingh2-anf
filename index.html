      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>
        To escape the pressures of my situation and to rehearse, I finds some peace and calm in the mountains of the 
        Engadine region in the Swiss Alps. In a defining moment of the film, I stands on a mountaintop and intensely 
        searches for a line of clouds that move like a snake and dramatically envelope the mountains with magical effect.
